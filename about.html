That’s exactly why you should read on as machine learning and IoT are <strong>mega-trends</strong> that will affect everybody, in your working and private life.</p><p>The blog targets executives and consultants that want to understand the topics to <strong>make the right decisions</strong> for their company or clients as well as software engineers, data scientists and makers that <strong>want to understand</strong> how to work on the technical side of things.</p><p>As the main and and adjunct topics are complex and the complexity is growing, there is lot’s of ground to cover - this is why you can expect <strong>one blog post per week</strong> at least in the near future. Things might change when I am fully focused on paid work again - read more about this below ,-)</p><p>Be warned: as some of the stuff I will cover in this blog might feel quite dry I take the freedom to add a <strong>personal anecdote</strong> here and there.</p><h3 id="why-this-blog-was-created-and-why-you-should-care">Why this blog was created and why you should care</h3><p>First and foremost this blog is an experimental way to get back my Zen. Having worked to much in the past my work life balance got lost. Time will tell if blogging is a good way to stimulate my creative side again and <strong>have fun</strong> ,-)</p><blockquote><p>“Express Yourself”. <cite>Madonna, 1989<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></cite></p></blockquote><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GsVcUzP_O_8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Second the topic “smart IoT” is of great interest for me personally. As part of my formal studies in Technical University of Berlin I proudly worked as a <a href="https://www.flp.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg53/KIT-Reports/r132.pdf" target="_blank">researcher</a> in the “FLP/KIT institute” managed by <a href="https://www.wissensforschung.tu-berlin.de/menue/ueber_uns/teilbereichsleiter/prof_dr_bernd_mahr/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Bernd Mahr</a> with KIT standing for “Künstliche Intelligenz beim Textverstehen” (“artificial intelligence for understanding text”). I studied formal and statistical ways to make machines “smart”. However the computational barrier was to high for some of the algorithms, given the throughput and efficiency of central processing units of that time - GPUs were not even invented back than. The algorithms studied than are called “machine learning” nowadays - I remember telling my peers that <strong>I will be back working with machine learning when computational power increased by one magnitude - which is now</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p><p>Third “smart IoT” is one of the few mega-trends that will effect everybody and every business. I worked for a lot of clients in the past that were hard to convince when mega-trends arrived and tried to stick to what was known and working. Interestingly enough the bigger and more obvious the change ahead the more rigid was the belief that nothing will change. Sadly enough this let to some frogs boiling<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. This blog might help some to <strong>invest in “smart Iot” early</strong> and experiment with what it might mean to their business, before others take it away.</p><p>Fourth “smart IoT” is just an application of “machine learning” to “edge devices” - it is complex but not really complicated. If some of the articles <strong>lower the barrier</strong> for software engineers, data scientists and makers to study it, I have already succeeded.</p><p>In addition I am lazily <strong>looking for a new job</strong><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> - I needed some place to guide headhunters to so I can ingress opportunities in a more structured and efficient way - this is the place and the little chatbot <a href="#" onclick="collectchat.open()"><strong style="text-decoration: underline; color: black">Ask Helmut!</strong></a> is there to help me focus on the part time holiday I am currently taking.</p><p>Last but not least I am tinkering with the idea of having a <strong>secondary income</strong> by being an author and educator. This blog is a way to challenge myself and check if I am capable of going into this direction before I take the decision to create some paid content. In the meantime you can gift me an (organic) smoothie - at the end of each article you will find an appropriate button - click it to send me a micro-payment.</p><p>Btw: All photos in this blog are shot with my iPhone with a little help by the embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A11" target="_blank">A11 bionic chip</a> that accelerates the inference based on a neural network pre-trained by Apple for computational photography - which is actually a good example of the machine learning on edge devices this blog is about.</p><h3 id="i-cherish-your-feedback">I cherish your feedback</h3><p>Some of the thoughts I will express in this blog are quite opinionated so <strong>you might beg to differ</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore there will always be <strong>something I missed</strong> when doing the research for an article.</p><p>… and don’t forget, this is the first time I am writing a blog which is why I am feeling quite insecure and long for <strong>confirmation</strong>.</p><p>This is why I added multiple possibilities that allow you to provide feedback:</p><ul><li>Below each article you will find a little forum that allows you to provide a reaction - such as an upvote - with one press of your finger or to take more time and write down your thoughts and insights.

No matter how in control you think you are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle… always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. <br/><br/>I wrote ‘Express Yourself’ to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It’s my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too.” <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id="fn:2"><p>While writing this I remember telling to reporters in press interviews that <strong>I want to have a chip in my brain</strong> in two decades and they thought I was crazy - this was in 1999.
